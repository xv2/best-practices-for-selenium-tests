# How to

Make sure you have  **NodeJS** 

Use `npm install` to install packages.

You need start the application with command `npm start`. The application will be running at  [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) , if you need start on the other port you can change a start command in the `package.json` file.

For the best start test scenario use command `npm run test:best`

For typical start  test scenario use command `npm run test:typical`

P.S. You can also run `npm run prettier` for code formatting 

*TODO: Add `best+jest` test scenario*
